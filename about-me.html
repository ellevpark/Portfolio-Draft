            <hr class="my-4">

            <p class="lead">My interest in computer science was ignited when I learned of a woman who was diagnosed with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, a critical condition where her heart was 3 times the size of the average healthy human. She was given a pacemaker defibrillator that ran on code that would shock her if her heart ever stopped. When she got pregnant, she experienced palpitations, highly common during pregnancies, but her pacemaker shocked her. This was not a malfunction but rather an unanticipated situation in discussion. This happening emphasized my value for inclusion and diversity of thinking in these collaborative rooms. I want to use my unique experiences to contribute to these pools of thought to find solutions to address complex issues.

            <p class="lead">
            Coming from a diverse background of psychology, history, and non-profit mortgage banking, I have accumulated skills that cultivate logic and fuel creative changes. I am an avid writer who advocates for mental health, meticulous researcher, and insightful problem solver. Changing my career path and going through a rigorous coding program was one of the most pivotal decisions of my life. This is my investment in myself. I know my potential and strive to take advantage of the infinite opportunities to continuously grow and finesse my skills in a multitude of program languages. The more I learn about code the more I want to know.
